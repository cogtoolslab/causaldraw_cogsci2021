# How do semantic properties of visual explanations guide causal inferences?
camera-ready version for github repo release

How do we communicate our causal knowledge to others?
This repo contains code for a custom web platform for collecting visual depictions
("what something looks like") and visual explanations ("how something functions").
Hypothesis: representational accuracy may not only guide visual production behavior
but also that communicative intent may guide how we decide to prioritize information
to convey semantically meaningful content to others.

For each trial, participants watched a video demonstration (~30s) of a machine
and were then prompted to produce a visual depiction or visual explanation of the machine. While drawing, participants could not see the machine.
Participants each produced 6 sketches.
